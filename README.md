# State-Of-The-Union Speeches

This repository contains all current State-Of-The-Union Speeches in `.txt` format for easier processing. The speeches are fetched from the excellent project at [stateoftheunion.onetwothree](http://stateoftheunion.onetwothree.net/texts/index.html).

All current speeches can be found in the `speeches` directory.

Running `get_sotu.py` updates the speech `.txt` files.
